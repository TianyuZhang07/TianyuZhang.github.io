abstract: This study attempts to explore dynamic planning and decarbonization pathways of the highway power supply network (HPSN) under four carbon emission reductions (CER) policies, including transport demand control, electrification of transport vehicles, transformation of regional power structure, and the highway energy self-sufficiency (HESS) construction. The developed dynamic deployment optimization and evaluation model includes three modules. (1) CER scenario quantification, (2) two-stage HPSN dynamic deployment optimization model, and (3) dynamic life-cycle assessment. Taking the HPSN of the Hoh-Bao-Eu-U urban agglomeration in China as a real case. 10 CER scenarios spanning from 2020 to 2050 are constructed. Firstly, the opportunities and challenges of the practical implementation of the HESS system are discussed. The HESS shows a strong potential role in the HPSN's decarbonization pathway. It could result in a 9.66 % reduction in peak carbon in 2035 and a 17.76 % increase in 2050 CER benefits compared to existing policies. Moreover, the multi-stage HESS project demonstrates positive economics, with the internal rate of return ranging from 12.14 % to 14.31 %. Further, the decarbonization pathways of the HPSN under various CER scenarios illustrate that the highway passenger car transport sector will achieve carbon peaking in 2030â€“2035, and the standardized carbon emissions in 2050 will range from 7.55 % to 56.56 % of those in 2020.
