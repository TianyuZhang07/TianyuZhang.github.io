summary: The synergistic operation of the “Source-Grid-Load-Storage” in the new transportation-energy system is widely regarded as an important means to effectively enhance the comprehensive operational efficiency of the two systems and promote the decarbonization of the transportation sector. Based on analyzing the multiple dynamic interaction relationships, including source-source complementarity, source-grid coordination, grid-load interaction, grid-storage interaction, and source-load interaction within the system and rich urban geography, traffic, and grid big data, we adopt data-driven and multi-agent simulation technology to realize the cooperative operation and management of “Human-Vehicle-Road-Charger-Energy-Information” in the transportation-energy system. It provides a data foundation with fine spatial granularity, precise temporal granularity, and rich state dimension for the operation and management, facility deployment, and industrial assessment of transportation-energy systems.

  To explore the potential applications of new transportation energy systems in different scenarios, we have designed and operated the Highway charging network with wind-photovoltaic-energy storage, the Taxi battery swapping network, and the urban V2G response and dispatch system.       
  
  Considering the dynamic interaction and transmission of traffic flow, energy flow, and information flow and the multiple en-route charging activities of electric vehicle users in the highway energy self-sufficiency system, we developed a multi-agent-based dynamic traﬀic assignment (MA-DTA) model. The MA-DTA model consists of two layers, i.e., the agent decision layer (Module B-1: Charging demand response) and the system simulation layer (Module B-2: EV status update mechanism; Module B-3: EFCS operation service simulation; Module B-4: Dynamic traffic flow transmission). The simulation system has the functions of accurately capturing the differentiated charging demand of individual EV users, monitoring the daily working conditions of charging facilities and road traffic, as well as collaborative power management of “wind-photovoltaic-energy storage” power generation facilities at the network level on a minute-by-minute basis.        

  Regarding the electrification of the taxi industry, we explore the daily operation of taxi transport services and energy replenishment services under the battery swapping mode. Based on actual taxi GPS data, we adopt a data-driven approach to simulate and model the dynamic interactions of passenger order requests, driver battery swapping decision-making, and battery swapping service within the taxi battery swapping network under the premise of modeling taxi drivers' battery swapping behaviors during operation using a discrete choice model. The simulation system realizes the reconstruction of the taxi travel chain embedded in the battery swapping activities, conducts second-by-second high-precision simulation, and monitors the taxi transport services and energy replenishment services.         

  In addition, we designed a V2G management system for urban private car commuter users. A comprehensive V2G response and dispatch system was developed using residential travel survey data and grid load data. It combines a daily trip chain-based V2G demand estimation method with a real-time ordered V2G grid scheduling model with virtual tariff minimization in a rolling time window framework. The simulation system realizes the demand response capture and grid management for urban private car commuters under fixed and non-fixed parking places throughout the day.
