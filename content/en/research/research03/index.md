summary: Focusing on the transportation industry, we conduct a comprehensive assessment and analysis of the medium- to long-term multi-stage deployment, low-carbon pathways, economic feasibility, and transportation service levels of transportation-energy networks in different energy and economic development backgrounds. It aims to provide policy advice and support to governments, enterprises, investors, and operators on planning and management, thereby promoting the sustainable development of the electrified transportation industry.

brief_description: |-
  In methodology, we developed a comprehensive model, multi-stage deployment planning, and life-cycle-based assessment in dynamic energy and economic scenarios (MDP-LCA-DEES) for the long-term operation and planning projects of transportation-energy networks. It is one of the few models that deeply integrates facility deployment planning and project feasibility assessment based on a comprehensive grasp, mapping, and quantification of the dynamic evolution of the macro energy and economy. The model leverages the synergistic benefits of operations simulation, deployment optimization, and project assessment. It contributes to the dynamic balance between transportation travel demand and energy replenishment and provides sustainable policy recommendations on dynamic deployment, decarbonization pathways, and investment management for transportation-energy networks.

  We conducted two studies on electrification development paths for highway passenger car transport (HPCT) and urban taxi battery swapping station (UT-BSS). Taking the highway network of the Hoh-Bao-Eu-U urban cluster in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, as an example, we attempted to explore dynamic planning and decarbonization pathways of the highway power supply network (HPSN) from 2020 to 2050 under the four carbon emission reduction (CER) policies, including transport demand control, electrification of transport vehicles, transformation of regional power structure, and the highway energy self-sufficiency (HESS) construction. This study focuses on the CER benefits and return on investment (ROI) of the new initiative of constructing the HESS system. This provides essential guidance for the government, the market, and enterprises to promote the implementation of this policy in the future actively. Further, the HPCT sector’s carbon emission pathways during 2020–2050 under ten different policy scenarios are discussed. It will provide policy support for decarbonizing the HPCT sector with sustainable services, positive environmental benefits, and good operational economics.       

  To explore the potential application of the battery swapping mode in the taxi industry, we examined the deployment, decarbonization, economy, and transport service development pathways of UT-BSS projects in various energy and economic development scenarios. The energy indicators include electrification of the taxi fleet, development of battery energy consumption technology, and transformation of the transportation power structure. The economic indicators include the development of the new energy facilities’ manufacturing technology, government subsidies, and socio-economic development. It emphasizes analyzing the game between CER benefits and ROI of UT-BSS in various energy and economic development scenarios. A CER-prioritized strategy is proposed for UT-BSS planning and management. It supports governments, enterprises, and investors in building and managing a UT-BSS network with sustainable transport service levels and good economic benefits under different low-carbon goals.
