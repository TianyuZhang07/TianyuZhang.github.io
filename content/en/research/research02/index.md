summary: In the past few decades, the problem of infrastructure station planning has been well-studied. We have categorized station planning studies into three phases, depending on the planning subject and the demand estimation. Limited by the model structure and algorithm efficiency, most of the 0.0 traditional planning studies optimize the deployment of charging stations based on static user energy demand. On this basis, we have adhered to the concept of integration of operation and planning in the 1.0 planning study, which considers the dynamic operational interactions of each subject within the system while deploying facility resources at the planning level. It helps to realize the matching of supply and demand between the facility resources and dynamic energy demand in the spatial and temporal dimensions and guarantees the dynamic and sustainable operation of the transportation and charging networks. Further, the 2.0 planning study is oriented towards the transportation-energy multi-network coupling planning problem, which aims to solve the problem of uncoordinated traffic flow, replenishment facilities, and energy supply. Collaborative operation and layout planning of transportation, power supply, and power generation networks is implemented by considering the coupled interaction between traffic flow, energy flow, and information flow, as well as the efficient utilization of transportation and energy system resources.

  We have conducted a series of studies on the application of 1.0 planning and 2.0 planning in different scenarios. In 1.0 planning, we use a bi-level optimization model and a data-driven optimization model to optimize the deployment of highway fast charging networks and urban taxi battery swapping networks, respectively. In 2.0 planning, two promising transportation-energy integration modes in highway scenarios are investigated: regional power structure transformation and distributed highway transportation-energy system construction.        

  The first highway transportation-energy integration mode is the regional power structure transformation. This mode is applicable to highway networks with well-developed service area grids and significant regional energy advantages. In this mode, the power of the highway service area is supplied only by the local grid, and the highway transportation energy use is cleaned up by transforming and optimizing the overall power structure in the region. In the dynamic regional power structure transformation, we aim to achieve a multistage, orderly highway fast charging network planning. Under the prerequisite of the highway fast charging network’s sustainable operation, network accessibility, and orderly construction, a three-step planning method is developed to enhance energy saving and emission reduction benefits and rationalize facility utilization. An empirical study of the Shandong Peninsula urban agglomeration was conducted. In the context of the development plan of the nuclear power cluster in Jiaodong Peninsula, the multistage deployment schemes for the Shandong Peninsula urban agglomeration highway fast charging network from 2025 to 2045 are researched in the empirical study. It elaborates on the importance of the planning concepts adhered to in this model, such as integrating operation and planning, playing the role of network demand induction, and guaranteeing the accessibility of electric vehicles for the planning and management of highway charging networks.       

  The second highway transportation-energy integration mode is the distributed highway transportation-energy system construction. Distributed transportation energy systems are especially suitable for highway networks with weak service area grids but abundant regional renewable energy sources. In this mode, the highway service area builds a miniature power network that can be operated in parallel with the large grid and isolation by integrating distributed wind turbines, photovoltaics, energy storage, controllable loads, and the primary grid in a unified manner. This study aims to provide an effective planning method for decision-makers in building a high level of service, self-sufficient renewable power, and sustainable Highway charging network with wind-photovoltaic-energy storage (HCN-WPE). To address the planning problem of the HCN-WPE system with the coupled multi-networks, a nested bi-level optimization model is proposed based on the resolution of the interactions among the networks. It realizes the joint operation and planning of EV users, power supply facilities, and power generation facilities on the highway. The deployment of the charging station location and capacity, as well as the installed capacity and rated power of its supporting wind-photovoltaic-energy storage power generation system, are optimized to maximize the net present value of the network. For solving the joint operation and planning problem, an algorithm structure based on a heuristic algorithm, multi-agent-based simulation technology, and linear programming algorithm, abbreviated as the H-M-L algorithm, is developed. Then, the “Hu-Bao-Wu” urban agglomeration in Inner Mongolia is selected as a real case to explore and discuss the managerial insights for the HCN-WPE system. The study demonstrates that the proposed model realizes the in-depth coupling of the transportation, charging, and power generation networks. It actively plays the demand managing and inducing role of transport infrastructure on the transportation side and fully exploits the advantages of complementary power generation from multiple REs and the role of energy storage devices in peak-shaving and valley-filling on the energy side.
