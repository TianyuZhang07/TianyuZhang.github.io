#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I (Tianyu Zhang) am pursuing my PhD degree in Transportation Planning and Management at Beijing Jiaotong University (2015-present) under the supervision of Prof. Enjian Yao at Beijing Jiaotong University, Prof. Junyi Zhang at Southeast University, and Prof. Wang, Zhiwei (David) at Nanyang Technological University. Based on the national strategy of “Integration of transportation and energy” and with the support of the Key Laboratory of Transportation Industry of Big Data Application Technologies for Comprehensive Transport, we are actively carrying out the cross-discipline between transportation, electricity, and economy, hoping to promote the sustainable development of the electrified transportation industry. The research mainly focuses on the integration of transportation and energy, involving transportation big data mining, intelligent system design and operation, network modeling and optimization, and industrial policy assessment and formulation. During the doctoral period, I published 5 SCI papers as the first/corresponding author in Area 1 of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, presided over 2 basic scientific research operations in central universities, and participated in 4 national natural projects and 3 provincial & ministerial projects. I was awarded the National Scholarship for Doctoral Students for two consecutive years (2023 and 2024). Currently, I serve as a reviewer for the journals TR-Part E and Applied Energy.
