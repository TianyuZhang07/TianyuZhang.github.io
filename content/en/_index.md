      subtitle: ''

        The deep integration of electrified transportation and energy systems plays an important role in enhancing the operational efficiency of the two systems and realizing the goals of travel convenience, peak shaving and valley filling, energy saving, and emission reduction. Our research is carried out for the coupled transportation, power, and energy system to develop a synergistic operation system that can accurately manage travel demand, station replenishment, and energy supply. Accordingly, at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels, we research synergistic operations, optimal decision-making, and sustainable development of transportation and energy systems with multi-network coupling and multi-agent interaction. We have successively carried out case studies on the Highway charging network with the wind-photovoltaic-energy storage, the Taxi battery swapping network, the Urban V2G (Vehicle-to-grid) response and dispatch system.
        
        Regarding academic achievements, I have published 8 academic papers, participated in 1 international symposium, authorized/publicized 3 national invention patents, and 2 soft writings. Among them, 5 SCI have been published as the first author/corresponding author in CAS Area 1, and 1 SCI in CAS Area 1 and 1 EI has been published as the second author and supervisor's first work. Research results have been published in TOP journals in transportation and energy, including TR-Part A/D, IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering, and Applied Energy. Regarding research projects, I have presided over 2 Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and participated in 2 Key Programs of National Natural Foundation projects, 2 National Natural Foundation projects, and 3 provincial & ministerial projects.        
        
        In the future, we will continue to work deeply in transportation and energy integration. To help the transportation sector achieve the goal of ‚ÄúDouble carbon,‚Äù we will develop new modes and new business models for transportation and energy integration in the fields of highways, urban roads, and railroads by effectively combining the smart grid and transportation infrastructure network and deeply integrating intelligent transportation and energy management. We sincerely hope to communicate and cooperate with experts and scholars from various disciplines to actively explore and solve complex problems within the cross-field of transportation, electricity, and economy. Let‚Äôs promote the development and innovation of transportation and energy integration together!    design:
